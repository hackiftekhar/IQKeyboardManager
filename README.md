Often while developing an app, We ran into an issues where the iPhone keyboard slide up and cover the `UITextField/UITextView`. `IQKeyboardManager` allows you to prevent issues of the keyboard sliding up and cover `UITextField/UITextView` without needing you to enter any code and no additional setup required. To use `IQKeyboardManager` you simply need to add source files to your project.

## Warning

- **If you're planning to build SDK/library/framework and wants to handle UITextField/UITextView with IQKeyboardManager then you're totally going on wrong way.** I would never suggest to add IQKeyboardManager as dependency/adding/shipping with any third-party library, instead of adding IQKeyboardManager you should implement your custom solution to achieve same result. IQKeyboardManager is totally designed for projects to help developers for their convenience, it's not designed for adding/dependency/shipping with any third-party library, because **doing this could block adoption by other developers for their projects as well(who are not using IQKeyboardManager and implemented their custom solution to handle UITextField/UITextView thought the project).**
- If IQKeyboardManager conflicts with other third-party library, then it's developer responsibility to enable/disable IQKeyboardManager when presenting/dismissing third-party library UI. Third-party libraries are not responsible to handle IQKeyboardManager.

Installation
==========================

#### Installation with CocoaPods

[![CocoaPods](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/IQKeyboardManager.svg)](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/IQKeyboardManager)

***IQKeyboardManager (Objective-C):*** IQKeyboardManager is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), to install
it simply add the following line to your Podfile: ([#9](https://github.com/hackiftekhar/IQKeyboardManager/issues/9))

```ruby
pod 'IQKeyboardManager' #iOS8 and later

pod 'IQKeyboardManager', '3.3.7' #iOS7
```

***IQKeyboardManager (Swift):*** IQKeyboardManagerSwift is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), to install
it simply add the following line to your Podfile: ([#236](https://github.com/hackiftekhar/IQKeyboardManager/issues/236))

*Swift 4.0 (Xcode 9.0)*

```ruby
pod 'IQKeyboardManagerSwift'
```

*Or you can choose version you need based on Swift support table from [Requirements](README.md#requirements)*

```ruby
pod 'IQKeyboardManagerSwift', '5.0.0'
```

In AppDelegate.swift, just import IQKeyboardManagerSwift framework and enable IQKeyboardManager.

```swift
import IQKeyboardManagerSwift

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?

    func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {

      IQKeyboardManager.shared().isEnabled = true

      return true
    }
}
```

#### Installation with Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate `IQKeyboardManger` or `IQKeyboardManagerSwift` into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "hackiftekhar/IQKeyboardManager"
```

Run `carthage` to build the frameworks and drag the appropriate framework (`IQKeyboardManager.framework` or `IQKeyboardManagerSwift.framework`) into your Xcode project according to your need. Make sure to add only one framework and not both.


#### Installation with Source Code

[![Github tag](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/hackiftekhar/iqkeyboardmanager.svg)]()



***IQKeyboardManager (Objective-C):*** Just ***drag and drop*** `IQKeyboardManager` directory from demo project to your project. That's it.

***IQKeyboardManager (Swift):*** ***Drag and drop*** `IQKeyboardManagerSwift` directory from demo project to your project

In AppDelegate.swift, just enable IQKeyboardManager.

```swift
@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?

    func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {

      IQKeyboardManager.sharedManager().enable = true

      return true
    }
}
```
