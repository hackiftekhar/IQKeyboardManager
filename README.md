You can use IQKeyboardManager to fix this issue with just one line of code:-

`[IQKeyBoardManager installKeyboardManager];`


Just drag and drop IQKeyboardManager class in your project. In your appDelegate write just one line of code. This will handle all UITextField/UITextView covering problem.


Feature:-
1) Support Device Orientation.
2) Easy integration.
3) UITextField Category for easily adding Next/Previous and Done button as Keyboard UIToolBar.
4) Enable/Desable Keyboard Manager with Class methods.
5) Enable/Desable Next/Previous with Category methods.
6) Autohandle in Whole application without any extra work or code.
